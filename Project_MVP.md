# Analysis of Exists Per Unit Station for Self-Driving Taxis Distribution Plan (MVP)
The purpose of the analysis is to design the distribution plan for the taxis across New York stations based on the total number of exits per station and the number of units per station.

As an initial observation, I noticed that the top 10 stations that have the highest number of registered exits are not necessarily having the highest number of units, refer to figs 1 and 2. Therefore, the basis of the distribution plan might be changed based on another feature of the MTA data.
