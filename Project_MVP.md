# Analysis of Exists Per Unit Station for Self-Driving Taxis Distribution Plan (MVP):
The purpose of the analysis is to design the distribution plan for the taxis across New York stations based on the total number of exists per station, as well as the number of units per station.

As an initial observation, I noticed that the top 10 stations that has the highest number of exits are not necessarily having the units, refer to fig 1 and 2. Therefore, the bases of the distribution plan could change based on another feature of the MTA data.
